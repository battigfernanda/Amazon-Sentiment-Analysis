Sentiment analysis project for Amazon reviews utilizing machine learning techniques. The project incorporates GloVe embeddings for text vectorization, a Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning, and an SVM model for classification. Additionally, I implemented SHAP values to enhance model interpretability and leveraged visualizations such as ROC curves and confusion matrices to assess performance. The model effectively classifies reviews as positive or negative while maintaining transparency in its decision-making process.
